# Wrapper for mpv to allow running multiple instances
# but still allowing to controll all of them using sockets
#
# Word of caution from man mpv regarding the used JSON IPC:
#   WARNING:
#      This is not intended to be a secure network protocol. It is explicitly insecure: there is no authentication, no encryption, and the com‚Äê
#      mands themselves are insecure too. For example, the run command is exposed, which can run arbitrary system  commands.  The  use-case  is
#      controlling the player locally. This is not different from the MPlayer slave protocol.
